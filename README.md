# Plantify
Planting is enjoyed by many people, but somehow everyone does not know which plant is to be grown and how it should be grown. There are many factors contributing towards the decision of which plant we should plant such as climatic conditions, geographical location, a lifetime of plants, weather conditions, etc. Even the slightest change in any of these conditions could affect the growth of the plants. This is the problem faced by a lot of people in both urban and rural areas while planting plants as they don't know which plant is best suited to be grown in their houses, offices, or gardens.  Also, a major issue faced by these people is that they donâ€™t know about a proper marketplace of plants and crops and get fooled by a few gardeners pretty easily. In our application, Plantify, we have tried to provide a solution to this problem by recommending to users which plants they could grow according to their location and weather/climatic conditions. Our application also lets users connect with a bunch of other anthophilous users where they can trade plants using our e-commerce model and get to know more about plantations through blogs and vlogs. We will also try to add a plant identification system to our application.
